### Installation and Requirements
```angular2html
cd <directory to store code>
git clone https://github.com/elizabethnewman/tensor-fmri.git
```
Requirements:
* Python version 3.7 or newer


### Organization

* data

We are using the [StarPlus fMRI dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-81/www/).  
This consists of fMRIs of study subjects who are shown either a sentence or an image.  We aim to classify the study subjects into these two categories.  The tensors contain pixel data of the 3D brain images of the study subjects over time during each trial.  

* tensor

Functions for all the needed tensor products and tensor SVD.

* tests

internal use to check code

* utils

Includes visualization tools and pre-processing tools.
